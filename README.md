# Radiative transfer code Dusty

There are two versions: 

1) The original 1999 version, known internally as V2. Instructions,
   the code, and supporting files for V2 are available from
   [the old Dusty's website](http://faculty.washington.edu/ivezic/dusty_web/)

2) The latest and greatest ("new and improved") version, known internally as V4. 
   You can get V4 as *tar
