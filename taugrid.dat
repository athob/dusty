  Sample tau-grid

This file can start with an arbitrary number of text lines (WARNING: the text 
must not contain the "equal" sign!). The beginning of data is signaled by the 
entry of the fiducial wavelength at which the optical depths are specified. 
Next is the number of entries, followed by the list of values one per line 
in arbitrary order --- DUSTY will sort them and use only the sorted version 
for internal work and output.  The number of entries is limited to 999.
