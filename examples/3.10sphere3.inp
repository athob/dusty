    Input data for DUSTY                                               
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 This is an input file for radiative transfer code DUSTY, version 07.2009. 
 NOTE: this input file is not compatible with old versions of Dusty 
 due to the added new input options. Examples of each input option are 
 given at the end of this file. For a more detailed description please 
 refer to the Manual. 
 
 This input file has a free format. Text and empty lines can be entered
 arbitrarily. The relevant numerical input, entered in standard FORTRAN 
 conventions, is flagged by the equal sign. The only restrictions are 
 that all required input entries must be specified, and in the correct 
 order, as shown in the template input files. The most likely source 
 of an input error is failure to comply with these requirements. 
 Single entries are always preceded by the equal sign and terminated 
 by a blank, which can be optionally preceded with a punctuation mark. 
 Some input is entered as a list, in which case only the first member 
 is preceded by the equal sign, while each following member must be preceded 
 by a blank (a comma, followed by a blank can be entered for additional 
 separation). Because of the special role of the equal sign as a flag for 
 input entry, care must be taken not to introduce any equal signs except 
 when required. All text following the `%' sign is ignored (as in TeX) 
 and this can be used to comment out material that includes equal signs. 
 All lines that start with the `*' sign are printed out in the output.

* NOTES:
* This is a complicated version of an input file, with many user supplied
* files.

	The flags governing file production are as follows: 
    If flag.eq.0 the particular file(s) is not produced. If flag.eq.1
	all model results are in corresponding files with extensions 'spp' 
	(sp.properties), 'stb' (spectra), 'itb' (images and visibilities, 
	if chosen), 'rtb' (radial profiles) and 'mtb' (messages).  If 
	flag.eq.2, each model result is in a separate file, with corresponding 
	extensions 's###', 'i##', 'r##', or 'm##'. In this case the 
	visibilities are in file 'fname.i##' if the latter is selected. If the 
	images flag.eq.3 the visibilities will be in separate files 'fname.v##' 
	(the flag for visibilities has to be the same as for images).
	Note that choosing imaging output requires entry of additional input 
	(please refer to the examples below or to the Manual).
