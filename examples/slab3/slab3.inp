    Input data for DUSTY                                               
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 This is an input file for radiative transfer code DUSTY, version 4.0. 
 NOTE: this input file is not compatible with old versions of Dusty 
 due to the added new input options. Examples of each input option are 
 given at the end of this file. For a more detailed description please 
 refer to the Manual. 
 

 The input file has a free format, text and empty lines can be entered
 arbitrarily. All lines that start with the '*' sign are copied to the
 output, and can be used to print out notes and comments. This option 
 can also be useful when the program fails for some mysterious reason 
 and you want to compare its output with an exact copy of the input line
 as it was read in before processing by DUSTY. The occurrence of relevant 
 numerical input, which is entered in standard FORTRAN conventions, is 
 flagged by the equal sign `='. The only restrictions are that all required 
 input entries must be specified, and in the correct order; the most likely 
 source of an input error is failure to comply with these requirements. 
 Recall, also, that FORTRAN requires a carriage return termination of the 
 file's last line if it contains relevant input. Single entries are always 
 preceded by the equal sign, `=', and must be padded by blanks on both sides; 
 the terminating blank can be optionally preceded with a comma. For example: 
 T = 10,000 K as well as Temperature = 1.E4 degrees and simply T = 10000.00 
 are all equivalent, legal input entries (note that comma separations of long 
 numbers are permitted).  Some input is entered as a list, in which case the 
 first member is preceded by `=' and each subsequent member must be preceded 
 by a blank (an optional comma can be entered before the blank for additional 
 separation); for example, Temperatures  = 1E4, 2E4 30,000. Because of the 
 special role of '=' as a flag for input entry, care must be taken not to 
 introduce any '=' except when required.  All text following the  '%' sign 
 is ignored (as in TeX) and this can be used to comment out material that 
 includes '=' signs. For example, different options for the same physical 
 property may require a different number of input entries. By commenting out 
 with '%', all options may be retained in the input file with only the 
 relevant one switched on.
